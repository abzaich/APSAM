# Abstract 
Anomaly detection is essential across various industrial applications, yet obtaining high-quality annotated defect data remains challenging. We introduce an Adaptive Progressive Learning (APL) strategy, built upon the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM), tailored specifically for anomaly detection tasks. In the APL strategy, anomalous images are classified into easy, medium, and difficult categories using an adaptive scoring mechanism. For easy anomalies, data augmentation is carried out using AnomalyGAN, and the generated images are stored in a dedicated knowledge base. Medium and difficult anomalies are further broken down into simpler components through a decomposer that is integrated with SAM. Anomalies that cannot be decomposed further represent the critical features of industrial defects and undergo focused learning. Our experiments on three datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining efficient image processing speeds. This work not only pushes forward anomaly detection methodologies but also offers a practical approach to transferring knowledge from large models trained on natural images to specialized applications.ted the model's image processing speed, confirming its efficiency in practical applications.
